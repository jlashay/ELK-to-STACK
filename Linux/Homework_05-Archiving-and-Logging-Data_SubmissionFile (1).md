### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
    **tar -xvf TarDocs.tar**

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory: 
   tar -cvvf Javaless_Docs.tar --exclude=Java* TarDocs/ 



3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
    **tar tvvf Javaless_Docs.tar | grep Java***


**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:
    **sudo tar cvvWf logs_backup.tar.gz --listed-incremental=logs_backup.snar --level=0 /var/log/**

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?
**The -c for tar is used to create, and the -x with tar is used to extract ; so it cannot be used together. Using the extract and create command with tar will bring an invalid error thats says you cannot creat more than one
-Acdtrux'.**

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:
   **0 6 * * 3 tar czf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log**


---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:
   **mkdir -p backups/{freemem,diskuse,openlist,freedisk}**

  

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
[#Prints the amount of free memory on the system and saves it to free_mem.tx

free -h >> ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

#Prints disk usage and saves it to disk_usage.txt

du -h >> ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt

#Lists all open files and saves it to open_list.txt

lsof -h >> ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt 

#Prints file system disk space statistics and saves it free_disk.txt

df -h >> ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt ]

    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
**chmod +x system.sh**

**Optional**
 Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
 
 We can cat each text file.
 
  cat backups/freemem/free_mem.txt

  cat backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
  
  cat backups/openlist/open_list.txt
 
  cat backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt




- 

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:
 **sudo cp system /etc/cron/d**

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

    ```bash
    /var/log/auth.log {
        missingok
        weekly
        rotate 7
        notifempty
        compress
        delaycompress
    }
]
    ```

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:
**systemctl status auditd**

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [num_logs = 7
     max_log_file = 35]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [-w /etc/shadow -p rwa -k hashpass_audit 
    -w /etc/passwd -p rwa -k userpass_audit
    -w /var/log/auth.log -p rwa -k authlog_audit ]

    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`: 
**sudo systemctl restart auditd**


5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:
**sudo auditctl -l**

6. Command to produce an audit report: 
**sudo aureport -au**

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications: 
**07/02/2021 22:30:02 1000 UbuntuDesktop pts/1 /usr/sbin/useradd attacker yes 224351**

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`: 
**sudo auditctl -w /var/log/cron**


9. Command to verify `auditd` rules: 
**sudo auditctl -l** **The rules display: -w /var/log/cron -p rwxa**

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:
**sudo journalctl -b -p emerg..err**

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:
**sudo journalctl --disk-usage**

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two: 
**sudo journalctl --vacuum-files=2**


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:
**sudo journalctl --priority=0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt**


1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [0 0 * * * sudo journalctl --priority=0..2 >> /home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt /etc/cron.daily]
    ```
